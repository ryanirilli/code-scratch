Local noble hops (i.e. Saaz) were harvested, local pilsner grains malted, and the soft water profile of the area augmented the other ingredients. Brewers utilized the cool cavernous landscape as a lagering method. The popularity of the pilsner style swept across the European landscape. It wasn't until the repeal of Prohibition that a blander variation of the pilsner took hold of the American beer market. The Bohemian pilsner is a style that we traced back to its roots in order to replicate.",

Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.",

        "description": "Our pilsner is a traditional Northern German Style Pilsner. It has a fantastic malty aroma with a slight spice from the hops. The head is brilliant white and floats on the clean pale lager. The sparkling mouthfeel gives way to a soft malt sweetness that is followed by a long, dry, crisp finish. The balanced clean finish taunts the mouth to take another drink. Lagered for a minimum of 8-12 weeks to ensure smoothness and drinkability.\r\n\r\nAll ingredients for the beer are imported from Germany. Brewed in accordance to the German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot) of 1516.",

We use German Pils malt, 2-Row malt and wheat to create a firm malty character with a crisp finish. This traditional Pilsner malt bill is complimented by German Lager yeast and German noble hops.

No wonder. We created this German Pilsner as a classic Lager Bier to offer crisp refreshment with full-bodied satisfaction. Lightning’s uniquely robust combination of German Pilsnermalz, German noble hops, and select Bohemian lager yeast achieves complexity coupled with hop spiciness. The spritely tang quenches thirst—a storm surge of flavor, ending in a brisk bite. A bright white, lacey head tops off this award-winning session beer. By using only natural carbonation, we keep both the taste and the look clean. Lightning Elemental Pilsner is brewed in keeping with the Reinheitsgebot, the Bavarian Beer Purity Law of 1516. It is best to drink Elemental Pilsner when fresh, we only release when it is ready for optimal enjoyment!",

In a time when “craft beer” did not yet exist in Chicago and pure, flavorful beer was virtually unknown in the US aside from imports —and people thought “Reinheitsghebot” was something you said when someone sneezed— this beer caused quite a stir.\r\n\r\nToday, we’ve painstakingly recreated Douglas Babcook’s original, ground-breaking recipe, right down to the exact hops and exclusive yeast strain. Its amber color, spicy hop-forward aroma, malty body, and creamy finish truly set this beer apart from all others.\r\n\r\nThe late beer critic Michael Jackson called this recipe, “The best pilsener I’ve ever tasted in America.”\r\n\r\nWe humbly agree.\r\n\r\nPlease share with your friends, and introduce them to the Baderbräu tradition.",

The re-launched Pilsner is in the style of a New World Bohemian Pilsner, with Motueka hops, as well as NZ Saaz and traditional Czech Saaz, which produce lovely herbaceous fruit driven notes in the aroma. It also has three different malts: Pale Pilsner malt; Caramalt for complexity and colour; and Carapils for biscuit maltiness. The Balmain Pilsner is well balanced with a rounded clean crisp finish, and is the perfect complement to seafood or on its own as an aperitif!",

This beer is a crisp and thirst quenching lager, a beer that’s a bit lower on the alcohol scale than our other offerings, allowing that après ski party to last well into the night. Saaz and Sterling hops are what Head Brewer PJ Goudreault generously doses our Ajax Pilsner with, allowed to mellow with age, these hops provide the definition of a ‘bouquet’ for a beer. Ajax Pilsner does not have the bitterness that can be found in the Independence Pass Ale, or even the Conundrum Red ESB, but instead has just the right amount of delicious floral character.\r\n\r\nAjax, like that cartoon guy? Nah, Ajax is Aspen’s local name for Aspen Mountain.  Visible from the brewery—come on, lets be honest—visible from everywhere in Aspen, Aspen Mountain dominates the southern sky. Offering amazing skiing both for the tree- and groomer-lovers alike, Ajax has everything… but beginner runs (no green circles on Ajax!). So, keep Aspen local, impress the locals, and order an Ajax Pilsner after shredding the gnar pow pow of Ajax Mountain.",

Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate.

Low to moderately low levels of yeast-generated sulfur compounds in aroma and flavor should be apparent, and low levels of acetaldehyde or other volatiles normally scrubbed during fermentation may or may not be apparent. The sulfur and acetaldehyde characters should contribute positively to the beer drinking experience. There should be no diacetyl detectable. Dry hopping is acceptable.

A modified decoction mash (a traditional German brewing process in which part of the mash is boiled) was used to create a more complex malty flavor and aroma despite the light character of the beer. Light malt flavors and grainy aroma are complemented by spicy and lemon-like hop notes. The finish is medium-dry with a pleasant, moderate bitterness.",

Inquiring whether it is a German, Czech, Bavarian, American, or any other style pilsner will result in an impatient sigh and the explanation that the whole philosophy behind this pilsner is that it does not fall into any categories. True, it is brewed with traditional ingredients (soft water, pilsner malt, saaz hops, and German yeast), but it is the way that these ingredients interact, and the characteristics of the yeast, that cause this particular pilsner to defiantly stand alone. The assertively hopped Freestyle pils exudes the flavor and the aroma of the classic Saaz hop (a tribute to Ã¢â?¬Å?the originalÃ¢â?¬Â pilsner), while maintaining enough body to balance but not overpower this hopÃ¢â?¬â?¢s pleasant, spicy tone. An unhurried lagering process so frequently overlooked by American craft brewers is strictly adhered to in the production of Freestyle, which makes this beer by far the most light, clean, and quenching beer in the Santa Fe Brewing CompanyÃ¢â?¬â?¢s line up.",

It has been a real challenge to reproduce the popular draught beer in the bottled format but as a lover of traditional Czech Pilsner I'm really happy with how the bottled Rudeboy Pilsner presents.\"\r\n\r\nThe beer pours a pale straw colour with an almost meringue-like head. The intense citrusy aroma and flavour is delivered by the New Zealand Motueka and Pacifica hop blend, which is balanced by sweet Euro malt, and finishes with a refreshing bitterness.\r\n\r\nRudeboy is Murray's interpretation of Pilsner made vaguely in the Czech style but with a New World twist. It pays homage to European brewing tradition using the old school lager brewing process of cold fermentation and extended conditioning periods, but the extensive late hopping takes this Pilsner in its own direction.",

        "description": "Brooklyn Pilsner is a refreshing golden lager beer, brewed in the style favored by New York’s pre-prohibition brewers. In the 1840’s, the pilsner style emerged from central Europe to become the world’s most popular style of beer. Like its ancestors, Brooklyn Pilsner is traditionally brewed from the finest German two-row barley malts. Germangrown Perle and Hallertauer hops provide a crisp, snappy bitterness and fresh, floral aroma. The flavor of the malt comes through in the finish. We ferment Brooklyn Pilsner at cool temperatures, and then give it a long, gentle maturation (lagering), which results in a beer of superior complexity and smoothness. We believe that you will find there to be none finer. Unlike mass-marketed so-called pilsners, Brooklyn Pilsner does not contain cheap fillers such as corn or rice, nor does it contain any preservatives or stabilizers. Brooklyn Pilsner is the real thing.",

These beers made use of hard water, like that of Lafayette, for that reason more malt was used and just enough hops to balance the beer.  Rather than change the “locally raised water”, we have added some Caramalt to our Pilsner malt bill to give this beer some malt character.  We’ve chosen Santium hops, which have a slightly spicy character, in a very simple hop schedule.  The result is a clean finishing Pilsner beer, unique to the Lafayette area and our wonderful local water.",

        "description": "It’s over. The Axis has fallen and the Allies have given you an early retirement.\r\n\r\nBut you’re a tank operator. Now what do you do?\r\n\r\nMight we suggest that you leave the stress of the German army behind and move out to California and learn how to hang ten. Clearly the relaxed attitude of the West Coast living and the lack of exploding mortar shells should appeal to you.\r\n\r\nGranted, it’s not that common to see guys checking out the surf from the turret housing of a German-built tank, but this is, after all, San Diego and stranger things actually happen from time to time.\r\n\r\nSo welcome! Surf’s up, fire up the old beast and invade your new favorite break. Just don’t make the mistake of forgetting an ice cold case of Panzer Pils so when we’re done you can reminisce about der Fatherland as we check out your old-school ride.",

We named this beer in honor of the Trauger family of Bucks County who came to America in 1747 and were among some of the earliest German immigrants to the area.  In 1767 Christen and Henry Trauger purchased two farmsteads in Nockamixon Township and have been a part of the fabric of this county, state, and country ever since.  Five generations and 6847 family members later our Head Brewer somehow got lucky enough to be a small leaf of that family tree, and this is our way of looking back not only on that history here in this country, but also our family’s history dating back to Germany.  Ironically enough, the Trauger family’s German heritage predates the introduction and widespread popularity of the Pils style, but nonetheless, this beer is brewed and named in their honor.",

        "description": "Barmen Pilsner was first brewed in what is now the AC Golden Brewing Company in Golden, Colorado. It was initially offered on November 12, 1997. The brewing was later moved to the Sandlot Brewery at Coors Field. In February of 2012, Barmen production was moved back to AC Golden Brewing Company in order to make room for more Blue Moon innovations at the Sandlot Brewery.\r\n\r\nBarmen was born of Pete Coors’ desire to brew a German Pilsner that tastes exactly like the great pilsners of northern Germany. The beer was named after Barmen, Germany; birthplace of Adolph Herman Joseph Coors. Barmen is offered in only a few bars and restaurants in and around Golden, CO.\r\n \r\nTo ensure you enjoy the full Barmen experience, bars and restaurants offering Barmen are requested to honor the traditional “German Seven-Minute Pour” and to serve the beer in the proper Barmen branded pilsner glass. When properly poured, it should look like this. Feel empowered to send the beer back to the bartender if it isn’t served correctly.\r\n\r\nThis Pilsner pours a golden straw color, with a beautiful cap of fluffy white foam that creates a “lace” on the sides of the glass as the beer is drank.\r\n\r\nTrue to the style, Barmen begins with toasty bread and biscuity flavors before being rounded out by the spicy and floral hop flavors that only the Noble varieties can provide. Full bodied for a Pilsner, the brew finishes clean and crisp with just the perfect level of carbonation. Well worth the seven-minute wait!",

We brew Downright in the traditional Czech Pilsner style, using 100% Pilsner malt and noble Saaz hops. To further accentuate the spicy aroma, we dry hop our pilsner with additional Saaz hops. Downright Pilsner gets its carbonation completely naturally as it lagers in our fermentation tanks for six weeks.",

Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.",

        "description": "Classic. Pac Pilly is a beer that hearkens back to the glory days of yesteryear, the ad execs and their trophy wives, the smell of easy money and taking off for a weekend at the Ol’ Cottage on the lake. It personifies decadent relaxation, taking time off, even for a minute and taking stock of your surroundings. This true pils — produced using an ISO-certified, double-fermentation process — is a crisp, clean, golden brew popular with anyone who loves a timeless blonde. I mean who can resist a timeless blonde?\r\n\r\nOur flagship beer has a classic taste that is beyond refreshing… crisp, clean, no aftertaste and dry in character like European style beers. Our Pils features the tart, delicate flavour of quality German Hallertau hops perfectly balanced with soft malt notes to produce a refreshing sensation on the tongue. With just a hint of citrus, it is a classic, clear, thirst-quenching brew. Perfect with fish or shellfish including a West Coast favorite – sushi.",

Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.

In 1842, an innovative Czech Brewery used a ground-breaking technique of methodical bottom fermenting with a new strain of yeast. The resulting brew, Pilsner, was a refreshing golden and bright beer that has now been adopted by breweries all over the world.\r\n \r\nPropeller Bohemian Style Pilsener, is a refreshing brew in the classic lager style of Bohemia. Made with a blend of Canadian and European malts and prized Noble hops, Propeller Bohemian Style Pilsener displays classic Euro-lager characteristics: a slightly sulphurous nose, distinctive Continental hop aroma, a light malt sweetness and a refreshing bitter finish.",

In combination with the traditional European Pils Malt and Bohemian lager yeast, we’ve created a clean, crisp and very flavorful beer. Route 52 is not a weak, timid American lager.\r\n\r\nRoute 52 derives its name from the National Scenic Byway that passes by Twin Lakes Farm. The community is rich in history, art and beauty. Our location and historic setting inspire us to craft a beer that reflects our heritage. From our traditional American style pilsner recipe to the painstaking effort we put into hand crafting this great pilsner, we feel Twin Lakes Brewery is “Preserving the Art of Brewing.”",

It is with great pride that we are making this classic European style lager available as our newest seasonal beer starting this summer from July till September. \r\n\r\nBrewed with North American lager malt and Czechoslovakian hops and yeast, Gold Mountain Pilsner beautifully blends old world and new. A lagering period (cold storage) of 4 to 6 weeks allows this most delicate of brews to become bright and clear. At this time, the malt character is now fully developed and the entire beer has lost its rough edges becoming soft and elegant. The perfect pint for a warm summers day or any day for that matter, Gold Mt. Pilsner rewards with clean, crisp, quaffable flavor every time.

Malt flavor and aroma are medium. This is a light-medium to medium-bodied beer. Sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS), fruity esters and American hop-derived citrus flavors or aromas should not be perceived. Diacetyl is not acceptable. There should be no chill haze.

Extremely low levels of diacetyl and low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character, if perceived, are characteristic of this style and both may accent malt aroma.

        "description": "The pilsner style beer (also known as pilsener or simply pils) originated in the scenic city of Plzen, Czechoslovakia in the early 1800's. Pilsners are lager beers, meaning they are brewed with bottom fermenting yeast, and then aged or lagered in cold conditioning tanks.\r\n\r\nSince their introduction, pilsners have become the most popular style of beer in the world. At Uinta, we have replicated a true old world pilsner by using the finest imported Saaz hops and then aging this golden lager for nearly a month. The aging process creates a smooth, mellow flavor that gives it a remarkable drinkability. Enjoy the delicate balance between the flowery hops and the assertive malt flavors.\r\n\r\nWhere did the name come from? Uinta embraced the concept of renewable energy in 2001 by committing to 100% wind powered energy. The name Blue Sky Pilsner stems from that commitment.\r\n\r\nTASTING NOTES:\r\nMalty taste and generously hopped. Citrus highlights. Finishes crisp and dry. Blue Sky pairs well with spicy food, and dishes such as chicken satay and grilled sausages. Try it with cheeses such as havarti, muenster, and monterey jack.",

        "description": "Pontius Road Pilsner is a true American-style Pilsner. The beer contains malted barley blended with flaked maize (corn) to produce a deliciously distinct flavor. It may be light in body and color, but it has a full flavor that gives way to a refreshing crispness. Handfuls of hops provide pleasant aromas and a wonderful dry finish.\r\n \r\nPontius Road Pilsner was designed to be like a colonial Pilsner. In colonial times, ingredients were often rationed so people used corn to supplement some of the barley in their beer recipes. Their Pilsners were also slightly hopped to add preservation. The name, Pontius Road Pilsner, derives from the road name that The Woodmaster, Bill Sohn, lives on. Bill encouraged Joe Short to move forward with his brewery business plan, and is a big reason why Short’s exists today!",

What separates it from our lagers and ales is the adherence to traditional Czech brewing methods. The use of mineral-less soft water keeps the hops smooth, and the beer light in color. A spicy nose seals the deal.",

Unlike many European beers, though, Four ‘Wives’ is just as at home accompanying spiced seafood or a Thai stir-fry as it is with hearty Italian or, to get in the Oktoberfest spirit, German sausage. With his rather bohemian approach to women in general and commitment in particular, James Squire was one of a kind. And with its Bohemian flavours, the Four ‘Wives’ Pilsener he’s inspired is equally unforgettable.",

Every autumn for over twenty years, Jim Koch has traveled to one of the oldest hop growing regions in the world, the Hallertau region of Bavaria Germany, to hand select the Noble hops for our beers, including the Hallertau Mittelfrueh variety.  This special variety is considered to be one of the best in the world.  Samuel Adams® Hallertau Imperial Pilsner is a celebration of these extraordinary hops. \r\n\r\nThis beer is one of the hoppiest in the world.  With the first sip there’s an explosion of some of the world's finest hops.  And we mean “explosion” in a good way.  This bold brew highlights the spicy, citrus flavors and aromas of the Hallertau Mittelfrueh hop that is abundant in the recipe.  The Hallertau Mittelfrueh hop is prized for its delicate flavor rather than purely for its level of bitterness.  As a result, the high levels of these hops give the beer an intense flavor without being overpowering. The beer remains well balanced from beginning to end, and continues to always be, well, \"hoppy,\" providing hop lovers with an amazing beer drinking experience.",

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

            "description": "A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.",

The two conspired to revive a recipe from the very beginning of Rock’s career, the memory of which he has cherished for more than 30 years. A starkly simple recipe combined with a painstakingly complex brewing process produce an Imperial Pilsner of subtle elegance and delicately balanced contrasts. First wort hopping, a very old technique in which hops normally added late in the boil are put in at the beginning, and allowed to steep for a much longer time, gives the beer an especially refined hop aroma and flavor. The 100% Pilsner malt makes a clear, yet restrained statement, answered by a stead, harmonious chorus of Saaz hop bitterness, echoes of which linger in the dry, crisp finish.",

A statement by the brewer explaining the nature of the beer is essential for fair assessment in competitions.

            "description": "Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are any range of color from pale to dark depending on underlying Belgian style being fruited. Clear to hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Fruit aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian-, farmhouse-, saison- and/or Brettanomyces-type yeast using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Malt sweetness can vary from not perceived to medium-high levels. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) and if present contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Body is variable with style. Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of fruit characters more so than the addition of fruit itself, within a Belgian beer style. As an example, a fruited Saison exhibiting some Brett character would be appropriately considered as Belgian Fruit Beer; whereas a fruited Brett Beer might more appropriately be considered as Brett Beer. Lambic-Style fruit beers should be entered in the Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic category. Fruited Belgian style beers brewed with additional unusual fermentables should be entered in this category. Fruit beers fermented using German, British or American ale or lager yeast would be more appropriately categorized as American-Style Fruit Beer or as Fruit Wheat Beer. For purposes of competition coconut is defined as a vegetable; beers exhibiting coconut character would be appropriately entered as Field Beer.",
