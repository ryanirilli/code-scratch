The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

Beers such as garden (vegetable), fruit, chocolate, coffee, spice, specialty or other beers that match existing categories should not be entered into this category. Beers not easily matched to existing style categories in a competition would often be entered into this category. Beers that are a combination of other categories (spice, smoke, specialty, porter, etc.) could also be entered into this category. A statement by the brewer explaining the experimental or other nature of the beer is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

Grilled beef finds a friend in IPA; so does your mom’s buttery fried potatoes.\r\n\r\nHowever, America’s popular potion can sometimes be known for a crisp astringency. Our IPA is fine-tuned with a floral, grassy note and a wild citrus gusto. First sips introduce a fruitful forward bitterness with a dry malt finish. Moderately carbonated and built with a medium body, our pale ale brings a seasoned, natural acridity to many types of savory sustenance and great conversation. From an ocean view to a sensual evening, the IPA here at Bad Water Brewing has plenty of good pairings. Keep it fresh, cold and ready to relish.",

Look for a big hoppy nose of citrus, grapefruit and floral notes that comes from dry hopping with a variety of American hops.  The flavor is of course hop driven but has a smooth malt backbone to keep things balanced.  The body is light with a crisp, minerally finish that allows the bitterness to linger.  This is the beer that will kick your mouth in the face.  The carbonation and bitterness really help this beer to lift heavy foods off of the palate so try this with big flavors as it stands up to the best of them.",

Lucky Bucket's Original American IPA begins with a nice malt bill that lets the brew stand up to the mountain of hops added later. After the boil, the hot wort (the beer before it's really beer) is fired through a hop back, a unique four-barrel stainless steel tank filled with a gratuitous amount of raw flower Amarillo, Centennial, and Cascade hops, extracting the aromatic oils and flavor of the hops. Followed with additional dry hopping in the fermenter, the end result is a big, well-balanced West Coast-style IPA with terrific hop flavor and aroma.",

Historically, hops were used primarily for their preservative characteristics to keep the beer palatable on long journeys. \r\n\r\nMany examples of American IPAs tend to be hop “bombs” that will make you pucker up with that “bitter beer face”.  We brew our IPA with just the right amount of bittering hops, but we make sure to focus on the more delicate qualities of humulus lupulus. That's why we load it up with late addition hops that inundate the senses with piney, citrusy and floral contributions.  \r\n\r\nNot that there's anything wrong with hop “bombs”.

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

Brewed with 2-Row Malt, Munich Malt, Caramel Malt, Victory Malt, and Honey Malt. Hops are Summit, Simcoe, Cascade and Willamette. Dry hopping the beer with Cascade and Chinook hops when it is finished with fermentation gives it its big hop aroma. Year Round Flagship. IPA contains 6.3% ABV.",

A huge amount of Pacifica hops are added in dry hop, which adds to this beer’s distinctive orange marmalade, rose petal and peppercorn character. Ripe citrus fruit aromas and flavors dominate, creating a beer that is an iconic example of TrimTab’s commitment to making expressive and complex, yet balanced craft beer. It’s an effort to answer the question, “what does it mean to be a Southern IPA?”",

Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.",

        "description": "Our I.P.A. is a dark-blonde beer with an emphatic, hoppy flavour. I.P.A. stands for India Pale Ale, a British type of brew in which the alcohol percentage and hop recipe were boosted so that the beer would survive the long sea voyage to the colonies. This recipe turned out to be a real winner and quickly became popular. In our I.P.A., we add hops to the beer during the maturing process as well as the brewing to produce delicious aromas of grapefruit and flowers. A beer with a fruity, bitter aftertaste that lingers for a long time.",

Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.",

Cascade, Northern Brewer and Falconer's Flight hops provide a hint of citrus and are perfectly complimented by a strong malt profile.  A 6.9% ABV adds a refreshing brightness to the beer while stopping just shy of the high alcohol levels of a double or imperial IPA.  Crisp, refreshing and well balanced, we are proud to put fourth our IPA as part of the American craft beer revival.",

        "description": "A classic IPA brewed to exacting standards – this is what an IPA should taste like. At the Brewery Farm we love to grow hops, after several years of playing in the hops gardens, we found that these farm fresh hops will make outstanding fresh beers. We’ve created 5 unique and classic beers to date, we challenged ourselves to complete the 6th, by carefully combining 4 of our bittering hops (Centennial, Sterling, Galena,Williamette) into a true IPA design - we nailed it. Subtle caramel malt provides enough sweetness to perfectly balance with an UNLEASHED bitterness of 48 B.U., within this bitterness is a citrus tone that moves almost to an orange finish. It’s so good, this is a refreshing IPA (you won’t hear that very often), that’s drinkable and shareable. Make some new friends today.",

An unabashed dosing of “dry-hops” gives way to abundant aroma and bright citrus flavor. Enjoy it in the company of good friends with barbecued chicken and mango-habanero salsa.",

The hops will come at you immediatly through the nose and follow through the flavor of the beer; while the malt will play a secondary role. Brewed with Pale, Crystal and Toasted malts. Hopped with 3 classic American hops.",

As a matter of fact, we enjoy each style to such a degree that one morning we elected to brew all three - at once. Prepare to revel in the outcome. The foundation for IPA Blanco is laid by traditional Belgian Wit grains (Pilsen / White Wheat / Oats) and spiced with cracked coriander, orange and grapefruit zest. Hops bound straight out of an IPA recipe (Cascade / Centennial / Columbus) and the yeast straight off a batch of American Hefeweizen. This fusion of beer styles results in a hazy, spirited brew proud to be part of the American Nanobrewery Hybrid Ale Revolution.",

Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.",

It is brewed utilizing only the Simcoe hop variety. This hybrid hop, developed and trademarked by Select Botanicals Group, LLC in the year 2000, was created for its high alpha acid content, maximum aromatic oils and low cohumulone (harshness) levels so that brewers can really put a lot of ‘em in a beer and not create an overly harsh taste.",

        "description": "Grand Teton’s Double IPA was born in our renowned Cellar Reserve program. Fans of our Double IPA and XX Sweetgrass demanded we brew the style on a regular basis. In response, we created Lost Continent in 2009 and updated it for 2010. This year's version is brewed with well over three pounds of hops per barrel in the kettle and another half-pound per barrel of “dry hops” in two additions during conditioning. A revised fermentation program has produced a more traditional Double IPA flavor profile--drier, less malty, more hoppy.\r\n\r\nWe use only American Pacific Northwest hops. Galena hops are added early in the boil for smooth, balanced bitterness. We add Columbus, Centennial and Amarillo later in the boil for flavor, and Columbus, Centennial and Simcoe in the whirlpool for aroma.\r\n\r\nFor even more aroma, we dry-hop with Summit, Columbus, Amarillo and Cascade hops in the conditioning tank, and dry-hop again right before bottling with whole-flower Cascade hops. The result is fruity, floral and complex, with notews of tangerine zest and fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice.\r\n\r\nIdaho 2-Row Brewers’ Malt and German CaraHell and Vienna malts give this ale its lovely pale copper hue, with flavors of orange marmalade and dried apricots, supported by a strong backbone of hoppy bitterness.",

They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.",

We also added nearly a barrel of unfiltered pineapple juice freshly juiced by Good To Go Mobile Juice Truck. This exotic brew exhibits aromas of toasted coconut, pineapples, mangoes and passion fruit flowers. Each sips starts sweet and finishes with a long finishing hop bitterness. It's like Hawaii in a pint glass. Kāmau kī`aha!",

It's a truly unique and distinctive IPA that is brewed with malted wheat, experimental hops and elderflower. The use of wheat enhances the complex hop profile. Two experimental hop varieties - Jarrylo and Belma - contribute fruity hop flavors that resemble blackberry and strawberry, while mellow floral notes of elderflower cover the palate. The finish is hop bitter as you would expect from an IPA.\r\n\r\nFor our annual collaboration beer, we teamed up with our longtime friends at Stone Brewing Co. - craft brewing pioneers known for their love of hops who, like BJ's, got their start brewing beer in Southern California in 1996. Together we decided to brew a wheat IPA with a unique hop profile.",

They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.",

He was involved in most aspects of the atomic bomb development. He participated in the selection of sites for research and production at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Los Alamos, New Mexico and Hanford, Washington. Groves had a reputation as a strong and bitter leader, so we found it appropriate to name our IPA after this great man.\r\n\r\nGeneral Groves is a big American IPA; bold, assertive, and full of flavor highlighting the complex citrus and herbal character of our Northwest hops.  The brewer of this IPA takes hops pretty seriously, which is why he added more hops to this IPA than any other IPAs we have produced. He spent a lot of time tinkering, tasting, and tweaking this recipe to get the biggest and best hop flavors and aromas into this beer. His diligence has paid off. His obsession with huge hop flavor led to this beautiful hoppy beverage.",

This sweet IPA was first released at the retirement party of our dear friend, and co-owner of Wig Wam Pub, Erik Sweet. The beer was brewed to be a play on his name while celebrating over 26 years in the Navy. After the partying settled we took to Facebook to let our followers and regular customers choose the official name for the beer. Suggestions piled in with hundreds of entries! While we were narrowing down the names, on the weekend of April 26, Erik was taken from this world. As a warrior and friend, we’ve decided to immortalize his memory in Valhöll. The Sweet IPA, will now forever bare the name: Erik’s Sweet IPA.

        "description": "NoCO IPA pours an inviting copper color topped by a strong, slightly off-­‐white foam. Your first sniff reveals the complex balance between the citrusy, spicy pear hop aroma backed by slight caramel malt notes. Tasting the beer takes you further into a flavorful American hop experience with plenty of hop bitterness balanced perfectly with the sweet malt backbone. This flavorful combination lingers on the palate yet finishes clean and prepares you for another sip. A very drinkable IPA, NoCO IPA reflects the hop forward yet balanced intent of our head brewer.  NoCO IPA is a beer that exemplifies the balance we all find in this beautiful region where we work and play.",

They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.",

This monster weighs in at a hefty 6.5% alc/vol, 65 IBUs and uses 4 different hop varieties, in whole leaf and pellet in 6 different additions. We use a healthy dose of Caramunich malt to give this beer a bright orange color and enough body to balance the hops. We use cutting edge hop varieties to create a crazy mix of pineapple, grapefruit and pine aromas that just screams American IPA. This awesome ale pairs well with other strong flavors such as aged natural cheeses, spicy sushi, curry, etc. Truly an IPA that sets a new standard for brewers and beer lovers on both coasts Cheers.",

They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops.

Rich maltiness and peppery rye blend to set the stage for the four different hops that push the IBU’s while keeping a bold, sweet body with just a hint of sour.   In the spectrum of Longstreet to Double Dragon, this Rye IPA definitely keeps it “in the family”.   Pairs with a wide variety of cuisine, but shines with smoky and peppery meats and cheeses.",

            "description": "Most traditional interpretations of English-style India pale ales are characterized by medium-high hop bitterness with a medium to medium-high alcohol content. Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.",

        "description": "Coffee was introduced to India a few centuries earlier by Baba Budan, the namesake of this beer. A merchant and a smuggler, the legend has it that Budan brought the first seeds of the coffee plant from Yemen to India sometime in the 17th century. The collaborative brew between AMB and Fonta Flora brewery in Morganton, NC is named after him. Just as he brought the new flavor of coffee to the markets of India, we are bringing you this new variety of IPA. We took a true West-coast style IPA and infused it with 40 pounds of locally roasted coffee from Expresso News coffee shop in downtown Boone. The result is a delicious mix of roasted and citrus aromas in a beer that will delight drinkers of both.\r\n\r\nCheers to Baba Budan and his unlikely path to bring these two worlds together.",

The beer served at the ‘62 World’s Fair nothing at all like this west coast style IPA, generously brewed with five varieties of Yakima Valley aroma and flavoring hops. We then dry hop it with whole-cone Columbus, Summit and Centennial hops, which impart a floral aroma that has catapulted this beer to one of Pike Brewing customer’s favorite IPA’s.\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\nOver 100 beer enthusiasts gathered at the famous Space Needle in 2012 to taste beers from a dozen local breweries. Their goal – find the one most evocative of the Northwest beer culture and capable of commemorating the iconic building’s 50th anniversary. We’re honored that Pike’s Space Needle Golden IPA took home the honors that day and has been turning heads and pleasing palates ever since.",

They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.",

Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.",

We think What Cheer is a much better way to describe a great place for social gatherings and a perfect name for a unique beer.\r\n\r\nIntriguing and complex, this IPA features aromas of mango, guava and orange. Brewed using specialty malts and a cornucopia of hops, it’s fermented with the Brettanomyces Bruxellensis wild yeast strain. Funky and fruity, this unique beer will delight your senses and leave your palate refreshed.",

In order to balance the strong hop profile, we built an appropriately robust malt backbone. The moment you pour Island 1842 into your snifter, expect a powerful nose of spicy, floral and zesty hops. The complexity of flavor will then continue to unfold with each sip and the flavor will linger on the palate.",

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.",

Primarily grapefruit and gooseberry, with a mild grass and spice note from the Amarillo hops. Light yet present malt tastes move in behind. The beer finishes crisp and dry, with a very mild training bitterness.\r\nOther Notes:\r\nFirst off this beer is not a traditional IPA, so those expecting a huge nit of bitterness will be disappointed. Session IPAs are lighter bodied and lighter in alcohol than a normal American IPA. Hop, and bitterness is used in beer to balance the alcohol. In a beer with a lower abv, the IBU must be lower as well in order for the beer to maintain its balance. In a session IPA very little bittering hop is used. Hops are added very late in the brewing process to create a strong aroma and flavour profile. This style is intended to a hop forward light beer, something that is well suited to the patio and hot weather. The session in the name refers to this style being a beer that one could consume in larger amounts due to the lower alcohol content.",

Lacking reliable refrigeration, brewers produced these ales with large amounts of hops and alcohol, which acted as preservatives in order to make the long voyage.  Here we’ve produced a strong, bold and fruity India Pale Ale in the tradition of the fine West Coast breweries. It is sure to please the hoppiest of hopheads. We start with 5 different malts to create a sturdy foundation for the hop assault. Then we build on this foundation with Bravo, Columbus and Centennial hops for bitterness and flavor. The pièce de résistance is the generous addition of a Cascade and Simcoe dry hop for a huge citrus and apricot aroma. Cheers!",

Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.",

If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.",

            "description": "Rye beers can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.",

A substantial increase in grain balances out the added bitterness due to the increased hop content. This beer is generously dry hopped, adding over one pound of hops per barrel incuding Galaxy hops to give the beer a tropical and citrus fruit aroma and flavor. A deceivingly drinkable beer, despite its higher alcohol and hop content.",

If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.",

New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Fruited or spiced beer that is wood and barrel aged would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port/ whiskey/ wine/ sherry/ other), base beer style or achieved character.

        "description": "A Hoplite Soldier was the most common type of heavily armed foot-soldier in ancient Greece from the 7th to 4th centuries BC, and most ordinary citizens of Greek city-states were expected to suit up and make themselves available for the role when necessary. If the Holplites were craft beer drinkers, they would need a flavorful, light-bodied, lower-alcohol IPA to keep them on their toes in case a battle ensued.\r\n\r\nHoplite has the massive hop aroma and flavor profile of a traditional IPA, with the sessionable characteristics of a lower alcohol beer.\r\n\r\nThis beer uses new hop varieties Belma and Azacca to create flavors and aromas of strawberry, melon and citrus fruits that will have you ready for battle or that afternoon in the hot summer sun.",

Premium two-row, Vienna, wheat, crystal and dextrin malts pop the starting gravity up near triple digits, then the American ale yeast ferments it out to over 9% alcohol. Blends of Centennial, Columbus, Crystal, Cluster, Caliente, Cascade and Calypso hops were added multiple times during the boil to provide balancing bitterness and flavor, and twice during fermentation for a lip-smacking finish. Get a driver if you indulge in this one.",

They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.",

The 8140 Black IPA was brewed in homage to the eight thousand one hundred and forty square feet of sheet rock we had to hang in our brewery.  As the ring leaders of the monumental task we naturally asked our supreme friends Jonathan Widen and Dave Thomas from Premier Painting Plus what kind of beer they wanted and naturally they said BLACK. So before you sits a Black IPA with an ingredient list as ominous as the color (basically it has more ingredients than will fit on the page). So enjoy the black hoppy goodness and avoid hanging drywall at all costs!",

            "description": "American sour ales can be very light to black or take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients. There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.",

            "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",
